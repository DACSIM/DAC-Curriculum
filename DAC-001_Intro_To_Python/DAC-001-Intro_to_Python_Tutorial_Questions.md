Intro to Python Tutorial Questions

1. Create a new Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file).
2. Save the notebook with the name of the topic (e.g., DAC-001-Intro-to-Python_Tutorial.ipynb) in the respective folder of the topic, in your repository in VSCode (My-DAC-Curriculum).
3. Solve each tutorial question (listed below) in separate cells of the notebook.
4. Save and Push your changes to your forked GitHub repository.

Question 1: Lists
Task:
(a) Create a list named fruits with the items "apple", "orange", and "banana".
(b) Add "tomato" to the end of the fruits list.
(c) Remove "apple" from the fruits list.

Question 2: Tuples
Task:
(a) Create a tuple named subjects with the following elements: "physics", "chemistry", "english", "math", and "biology".
(b) Attempt to append "literature" to the tuple and observe the result. Suggest an alternative way to add an element to a tuple.
(c) Count the number of elements in the subjects tuple.

Question 3: Sorting Lists
Task:
(a) Create a list named students_id with the values [10, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3].
(b) Sort the list in descending order and reinitialize it as sorted_students_id.
(c) Remove all elements from the sorted_students_id list.

Question 4: Generating Lists
Task:
Generate a list of numbers starting from 15 and decreasing by 3 each step, until the number is positive (not inclusive of zero). Store it in a variable named desc_list.

Question 5: Generating Lists
Task:
Generate a list of numbers starting from 2, increasing by 2 each step, until the list contains 14 elements. Store it in a variable named asc_list.

Question 6: Combining and Separating Lists
Task:
Combine the lists generated in Questions 4 and 5 into a single list named combined_list.
Separate the even and odd numbers from combined_list into two separate lists: even_numbers and odd_numbers.

Question 7: Functions
Task:
Create a function circle_properties(radius) that takes in the radius of a circle and returns both the area and circumference.

Question 8: Custom Function
Task:
Define a function that performs a task you find interesting. Demonstrate how this function works.

Question 9: Creating and Manipulating Dictionaries
Task:
(a) Create a dictionary named student_grades with the following keys and values: "Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, and "Charlie": 78.
(b) Add a new student, "David", with a grade of 92 to the student_grades dictionary.
(c) Update "Alice"'s grade to 88.

Question 10: Using Dictionaries to Count Occurrences
Task:
Given the list of fruits ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"], create a dictionary named fruit_count that counts the number of times each fruit appears in the list.
