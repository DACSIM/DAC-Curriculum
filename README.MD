## Setting up VSCode
VSCode stands for Visual Studio Code, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which basically means its a software which can read, write and run code files in several different programming languages.

If you need to download data files for your curriculum lecture, you can find them here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PIjOqFCnovo8kGbGQDfjFE17BAl_PtqF?usp=drive_link

1. Install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download

3. Open Visual Stuido Code, go to the extensions tab on the activity bar, and download the the following extensions:
  * Make sure all of these extensions are by Microsoft:
    - Python
    - Jupyter
    - GitHub Pull Requests

5. Congratulations! You are now ready to code!

## Forking the curriculum
In GitHub, "forking a repository" means to create a copy of all the files within a certain repository for your own GitHub account. For example, you can "fork" this repository to create a personal copy of the DAC curriculum materials inside your GitHub account.

If you need a more visual guide to understand how to fork a repository, you can find it here: https://scribehow.com/shared/Forking_the_DACDSA_Curriculum_Repository__uJ4bd99_TTWagei2bQgC1Q

1. <b>Fork the Repository on GitHub:</b>
  * Click on the GitHub link shared, which will open the repository in web browser.
  * Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. 

This will create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.


2. <b>Clone the Forked Repository to VSCode:</b>
  * <b>Open VSCode</b>:
  * <b>Open the Command Palette</b>:
    - Press "Ctrl + Shift + P" (or "Cmd + Shift + P" on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
  * <b>Clone the Repository:</b>
    - Type "Git: Clone" and select it.
    - Paste the URL of your forked repository from your GitHub account and choose a local folder where you want to save the repository.
  * <b>Open the Repository</b>:
    - Once the repository is cloned, VSCode will prompt to open the repository. Click "Open" to open the project in VSCode.


3.<b>Explore and Work on the Materials:</b>
  * you can now browse through the folders and files in the repository from the VSCode sidebar.


4. <b>Open Files and Edit:</b>
  * They can open any .py or .ipynb files and start working on the exercises, making changes in your local copy.


5. <b>Run the Code:</b>
  * To run Python scripts, you can right-click the file and choose “Run Python File in Terminal” or use the run button at the top right corner.
  * For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), you can run the cells directly in VSCode if the Jupyter extension is installed.


6. <b>Commit Changes Locally:</b>
  * <b>Make Changes:</b> you can make changes to the files as you work through the exercises.
  * <b>Stage and Commit Changes:</b> In the Source Control tab, you can stage your changes (click on the +icon next to each file) and commit with a message (e.g., “Completed exercise 1”).


7. <b>Push Changes to Their Forked Repository:</b>
  * <b>Push to GitHub:</b> After committing changes, you can push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub by clicking the "Sync Changes" button in the Source Control tab.
  * This allows you to save your progress online without affecting the original repository.
