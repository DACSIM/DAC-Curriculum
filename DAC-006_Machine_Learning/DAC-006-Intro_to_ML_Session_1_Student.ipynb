    "Machine Learning focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model is trained on a dataset to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions without human intervention.\n",

    "1.) Data Collection - Collecting data relevant to the problem you want to solve. \\\n",
    "2.) Training  - Using this dataset to train a model, which involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize errors in its predictions. \\\n",
    "3.) Evaluation - Testing the model on new, unseen data to evaluate its performance. \\\n",
    "4.) Prediction + Deployment - Using the trained model to make predictions or decisions on new data, and deploying it so that other users may use it as well."
